# FormOpt: A FEniCSx toolbox for level set-based shape and topology optimization supporting parallel computing

`FormOpt` is a toolbox for two- and three-dimensional shape with parallel computing capabilities,
built on the `FEniCSx` software framework. 
The numerical shape modeling relies on a level set method, whose evolution is driven by a descent direction computed from the shape derivative.
Geometric constraints are treated accurately through a Proximal-Perturbed Lagrangian approach.
`FormOpt` leverages the powerful features of `FEniCSx`, particularly its support for weak formulations of partial differential equations, diverse finite element types, and scalable parallelism.
The implementation supports three different parallel computing modes: data parallelism, task parallelism, and a mixed mode. Data parallelism exploits `FEniCSx`'s mesh partitioning features, and we implement a task parallelism mode which is useful for problems governed by a set of partial differential equations with varying parameters. The mixed mode conveniently combines both strategies to achieve efficient utilization of computational resources.

## Installation

Currently, `FormOpt` runs under FEniCSx 0.9 (we are working in a version for FEniCSx 0.10).

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for Windows, Linux, or macOS.
2. Create a Anaconda environment and install some basic packages:
	```bash
	conda create -n fenicsx09
	```
	```bash
	conda activate fenicsx09
	```
	```bash
	conda install -c conda-forge python=3.11.10 numpy=1.26.3 scipy=1.12.0 matplotlib=3.8.3
	```
3. Install FEniCSx and its core dependencies:
	```bash
	conda install -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx=0.9.0
	```
	```bash
	conda install mpich=4.3.0
	```
	```bash
	conda install pyvista=0.45.2
	```
4. Install additional packages (for mesh generation and working with HDF5 files):
	```bash
	conda install -c conda-forge pygmsh=7.1.17 h5py=3.10.0
	```
